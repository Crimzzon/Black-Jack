# Black-Jack

Hello! 

This is what black jack looks like if you have a fundimental misunderstanding of the game. But for the sake of just reaclling how to use Python I think its alright!

Super simple, Just play a single player game against a dealer that follows house rules. THe code is not commented as I was not here to remember how to comment.
Or maybe version 2 now out with comments! Who knows! Stick around. Or don't! it's very empty here.
